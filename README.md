# CPU Usage Tracker

This project is a **React** application that visualizes CPU usage data over time using a line chart. The app reads CPU usage data periodically (every few seconds), and updates the chart to show how the CPU metrics such as **User Time**, **Idle Time**, **System Time**, **Nice Time**, and **IRQ Time** change over time.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MUI** (Material UI) - Provides a set of React components for building responsive and accessible UIs.
- **MUI X Charts** - A set of React components to integrate charts into React applications, used here for the line chart.
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and enhanced development experience.



## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or above)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Step-by-step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bildad123/mui_charts.git 
   ```



## Running in Development Mode

When you want to run the application locally for development, follow these steps:

### Start the Development Server:

In development mode, Next.js will automatically reload changes when you save files.

- If you're using **npm**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

This will start your application at http://localhost:3000 by default. The development server enables hot reloading, so any changes you make to the code will automatically reflect in the browser without needing a manual refresh.
